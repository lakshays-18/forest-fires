Algerian Forest Fire Prediction
This project aims to predict the occurrence of forest fires in the Bejaia region of Algeria using various meteorological and environmental features. The dataset contains information on forest fire occurrences along with different factors that influence fire behavior. 

The prediction model uses advanced regression techniques, specifically Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression, to build a predictive model based on the data. These methods help improve the accuracy of the predictions by addressing issues such as multicollinearity and overfitting, commonly encountered in regression tasks.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 247 entries (rows) with multiple features (columns). The primary column, labeled "Bejaia Region Dataset", contains the key data used for analysis and predictions. The features include:

Date Information:

day: Day of the month.
month: Month of the year.
year: Year of the observation.
Weather Conditions:

Temperature: Temperature recorded on the given day (in °C).
RH (Relative Humidity): The percentage of relative humidity.
Ws (Wind Speed): Wind speed on the day of observation (in km/h or m/s).
Rain: Rainfall measured in millimeters (mm).
Fire Indicators:

FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code): Moisture content of fine fuels like twigs and leaves.
DMC (Duff Moisture Code): Moisture content of decomposing organic matter.
DC (Drought Code): Moisture content of deep, compact organic layers.
ISI (Initial Spread Index): Indicates the potential for fire spread.
BUI (Build-Up Index): Measures the total amount of fuel available for combustion.
FWI (Fire Weather Index): A composite index indicating fire severity based on weather conditions.
Classes:

Classes: Labels representing whether a fire occurred, e.g., "fire" or "not fire."
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict the occurrence of forest fires based on the FWI (Fire Weather Index) value. The FWI is a critical indicator of fire severity and spread potential, which is used as a key feature for forecasting fire outbreaks.

Regression Techniques
To predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires, this project uses the following regression techniques:

Lasso Regression: This method helps perform both variable selection and regularization, improving the model's accuracy by reducing the impact of less important features. Lasso Regression is particularly useful when there are many features and we need to determine which ones are most important for predicting the outcome.

Ridge Regression: Ridge Regression adds a penalty to the magnitude of the coefficients of features to prevent overfitting, especially when there is multicollinearity in the dataset. It is useful for improving the stability and performance of the model when features are highly correlated.

Both Lasso and Ridge Regression are applied to enhance the model’s predictive power and handle challenges such as multicollinearity and overfitting, which are common in real-world datasets.

Issues with the Dataset
The dataset contains some formatting issues that need to be addressed before analysis:

Columns might not be properly separated into a tabular format.
The dataset appears to have multi-indexing, which needs correction for easier analysis.
The data cleaning and reformatting process will be performed to ensure that the dataset is ready for use in predictive modeling.
